# Solutions to Frontend Mentor Challenges
- I embarked on this challenge to provide production-grade solutions to the published challenges as part of my ```NO ZERO DAYS``` journey.  
- This repo will do at least three things:
  - House all my solutions, serving as proof of accountability.
  - Simplify the feedback loop: ```share → gather → analyze → correct → repeat```.
  - Refine my learning in public method throughout the way.    
- I will use various development tools, frameworks and libraries to achieve my goals.  
  Best practices for accessibility and semantic accuracy will also be followed.
- Direct links to every solution will be provided.  
  A live version on a recommended or trusted hosting platform will also be linked. 
- You can join me on these challenges, no matter your skill level as there is [something](https://www.frontenmentor.io/challenges) for everyone.  
  Use the filters on the top right of the page to adjust your skill level and price preference.  
- Constructive criticism is most welcome, it is the only way I can grow.  
  Reach out on Twitter, or right in the feedback box on my solution page.  
  Thank you!
